     i.e. every statement of the code gets executed one by one. So, basically a statement
     has to wait for the earlier statement to get executed.(javascript is an single threaded language) -->

     <!-- posts = loadPostsSync();
          //fetches posts from some server
          //wait till posts are fetched
          //do something with posts
          doNextThing();
          //has to wait until posts load
          //blocking code -->

<!-- Asynchronous code allows the program to be executed immediately
     where the synchronous code will block further execution of the remaining
      code until it finishes the current -->
      <!-- loadPostsSync(function() {  //passing a callback function(much faster than sync js)
          //wait till posts are fetched
          //do something with posts
      });
          doNextThing(); //dosent have to wait until posts load
          (start something now and finish later) -->


<!-- API stands for Application Program Interface, which can be defined
     as a set of methods of communication between various software
      components. In other words, an API allows software to communicate
       with another software. -->

<!-- there are a few ways to work with async code
     1. callbacks
     2. promises
     3. async/await -->

<!-- AJAX: asynchronous javascript and xml
           set of web technologies to
           send and recieve data from client and server asynchronously
           does not interfere with the current page
           JSON has replaces XML for the most part
           make async request in the background
           no page reload/refresh
           fetch data
           very interactive-->
           
<!-- XMLHttpRequest(XHR) object:-
     1. API in the form of an object
     2. provided by the browsers js environment
     3. methods transfer data between client/server
     4. can be used with other protocols than HTTP
     5. can work with data other than XML(JSON(javascript object notation),plain text) -->


<!-- librabies and other methods : fetch api,axios,superagent,jquery,node http -->

<!-- example of asynchronous code
     console.log(1)
     console.log(2)
     setTimeout(()=>{   //this will take time hence output came at last
          console.log('callback function is fired')
     },2000)
     console.log(3)
     console.log(4)
     output:-
          1
          2
          3
          4
          callback function is fired -->
