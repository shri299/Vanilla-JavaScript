<!-- Rest APIs and HTTP requests -->

<!-- API:- Application Programming Interface
           1)  contract provided by one piece of software to another
           2)  structured request and response
           3)  we just worked with an API that takes a request and responds with jokes-->


<!-- REST APIs :- representational state transfer
                1) architecture style for designing networked application
                2) relies on a stateless,client-sever protocol,almost always HTTP
                3) treats server objects as resources that can be created or destroyed
                4) can be used by virtually any programming language
                5) all apis have their own rules and structures
                6) A REST API is a way for two computer systems to communicate over
                   HTTP in a similar way to web browsers and servers. 
                7) uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to
                   GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, 
                   updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.
                8) An API is an application programming interface. ...(API is a messenger)
                   REST determines how the API looks like. ...(REST lets us use http requests to format this message )
                   Each URL is called a request while the data sent back to you is called a response.-->


<!-- Types of HTTP requests:-
                 GET
                 The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.

                 HEAD
                Same as GET, but transfers the status line and header section only.

                POST
                A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

                PUT
                Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

                DELETE
                Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.

                CONNECT
                Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI.

                OPTIONS(return the supported http method)
                Describes the communication options for the target resource.

                TRACE
                Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
             
                PATCH
                update partial resources-->
